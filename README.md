Previous reporting from cybersecurity firms Kaspersky Labs, Symantec, and Fireye used patterns and clues within Wannacry’s code to conclude that The Lazarus Group, a hacking group known to be connected to the North Korean government, was indeed responsible.
At the time, the malware exploit only made off with about $140,000 in Bitcoin from those willing to pay, 
Since then, the three bitcoin wallets reported to be the depositories saw no activity. But on August 2nd, after over 300 unique payments, the perpetrators finally began to reap their ill-gotten loot. In a rapid succession of seven withdrawals, the three wallets were quickly emptied. 
The second major finding is that the DPRK routes substantial traffic through internet nodes abroad. Of course, China is in this mix. But the surprise of the report is that Chinese networks only account for about 10% of traffic, with India being a more significant player and Indonesia, Mozambique, New Zealand, Kenya, and Nepal all playing a role as well. These patterns underscore the need for greater coordination on cyber issues as well as sanctions enforcement.
